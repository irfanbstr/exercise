Blue

Blue is a cool spring day when you play outside.
Blue is a beautiful swan gliding in the lake.
Blue tastes like sweet blueberries for a delicious picnic.
Blue smells like a freshly bloomed flower.
Blue sounds like light rain on the windowsill.

Blue feels like a cool breeze rushing through my hair.
Blue looks like the bright sky on a summer day.
Blue makes me feel sad when I am alone.

Blue is bright and colorful.
